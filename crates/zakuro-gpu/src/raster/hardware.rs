//! filling triangles on the host's GPU through Vulkan. the GPU runs the
//! title's vertex shader, clips and culls, then does what costs, the
//! pixels, texturing, lighting, the combiners, the tests and blending. a
//! draw with a geometry shader has the CPU work out its triangles the way
//! the software path does instead.
//!
//! guest memory stays where images live between command lists. a buffer a
//! list draws into goes up to the GPU the first time the list needs it,
//! unless it is still as the GPU left it, and comes back down only when
//! something else is about to read it, a texture, a fill or the CPU.
//!
//! a display transfer out of such a buffer runs on the GPU as well, then its
//! batch goes to the GPU without waiting for it, along with a copy of the
//! output for the host to read later. recording goes on in a second command
//! buffer meanwhile, so the CPU rarely waits for the GPU.
