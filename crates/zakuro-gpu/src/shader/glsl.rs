//! a vertex shader program turned into GLSL ahead of time, doing operation
//! for operation what shade.vert does interpreting it, so the GPU runs the
//! title's instructions instead of an interpreter. everything the program
//! fixes is worked out here, the instructions, their swizzles and masks,
//! where each input sits and where each output goes, and only what changes
//! from draw to draw, the uniforms and the viewport, is read as it runs.
//!
//! a program without flow instructions becomes straight code. one with
//! them becomes runs of instructions between the addresses execution can
//! come in at, with shade.vert's block stack between them, so calls, ifs,
//! loops, jumps and breaks behave exactly as interpreted, odd ones too.
